            <p><em>deps</em> is a powerful replacement for Make using Python. Some major features are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>lazy dependency resolving</li>
                <li>automatic parallelization</li>
                <li>circular dependency detection</li>
                <li>complex relations through callbacks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But the most important feature of all is that deps is a <strong>Python library</strong>. There are no
            makefiles - you have the full power of Python at your disposal.</p>
            <p>deps can be used with ease on any computer that has Python installed. It is a <a
                href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightcracker/deps/master/deps.py">single file</a> that can
            live within your poject and requires no further installation.</p>

            <h3 id="a:introduction">Introduction <a class="a" href="#a:introduction">&para;</a></h3>
            <p>With deps your workflow is similar to Make. You define <strong>rules</strong>. Each rule has an <strong>output</strong>, zero or more <strong>dependencies</strong>, and has an associated <strong>process</strong> that produces the output. After defining the rules you ask for an endresult and deps will figure out which processes need to run to satisfy all dependencies, and run them in an optimal order.</p>

            <p>When starting with deps you'll first create your build script, and import deps. Then, you call <a class="api" href="#a:deps.build">deps.build</a> to ask deps to build all endresults.</p>
            <pre><code>import deps

deps.build()</code></pre>
            <p>This script does nothing yet, because we have not defined any rules for building yet.</p>
            <p>When you define a rule you will start by matching the <strong>output</strong>. deps attempts to match a needed resource with all rules, in the reverse order in which they were defined, until a rule is found that matches the resource. You can pass a string as the output of the rule, which will be matched as a Unix-style glob against all potential needed files. Alternatively you can pass a callback. Let's look at three examples:</p>
            <pre><code>from __future__ import print_function # only needed in Python 2.x
import deps

def match_numbers(output):
    try:
        int(output)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False

deps.rule("*.c", None, print)         # 1
deps.rule(match_numbers, None, print) # 2
deps.rule("test.c", None, print)      # 3

deps.build("test.c", "42", "x.c")</code></pre>
            <p>All rules we defined above have no dependencies, and call <code>print</code> as the process to generate the output. Obviously <code>print</code> will fail to do that, but that doesn't matter for our example. In our above example <code>test.c</code> will be matched to rule #3, because it was defined later than the otherwise perfectly valid matching rule #1. This is a point of care: you should always define general catch-all rules first, and more specific rules later. <code>42</code> will be matched to rule #2, because the callback will return <code>True</code>. And finally <code>x.c</code> will be matched against rule #1, because it matches the glob.</p> 
            <p>In deps all resources are assumed to be files, unless the name of the resource starts with a colon (:), then it is a virtual output. Only string equality, and not globs, will be used for matching outputs starting with a colon, but callbacks can be used if you really need pattern matching. This type of output is useful if you need to run a process that does not produce a file, for example setting an environment variable.</p>

            <dl class="function">
                <dt id="a:deps.rule">
                    <code>deps.</code><code class="cfname">rule</code><code>(output, dependencies, process[, run_callback])</code>
                    <a class="a" href="#a:deps.rule">&para;</a>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                <p>Adds a rule to the current environment. <code>output</code> is a string or a callable. If it's a
                callable it will be called with a dependency as argument and should return <code>True</code> or
                <code>False</code> depending on whether the match was succesful.</p>
